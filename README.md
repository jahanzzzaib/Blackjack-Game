# Blackjack-Game

Rules/Instructions:
Objective: The goal is to get a hand value of 21 or as close as possible without exceeding it. You compete against the computer’s hand.

Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.
Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which benefits the hand more.
Gameplay:

Initial Deal: Both you and the computer get two cards.
Your Turn: You can choose to draw additional cards to increase your hand's total value. Type 'y' to draw a card or 'n' to pass.
Computer’s Turn: The computer will automatically draw cards until its hand value is at least 17 or it hits 21.
Winning and Losing:

If your hand exceeds 21, you lose (bust).
If your hand is exactly 21 (Blackjack) and the computer does not have it, you win.
If your hand is higher than the computer’s but less than or equal to 21, you win.
If the computer has a higher hand without busting, you lose.
If both hands are equal, it’s a draw.
Special Cases:

Blackjack (21 with two cards, including an Ace and a 10-point card) wins against any other hand except the computer's Blackjack.
